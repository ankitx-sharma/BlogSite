# BlogSite
A Python-based web application for creating and viewing simple blog posts.  

The project allows users to add new articles and browse existing ones through a clean and intuitive interface. It is built using Flask and Jinja2 for the backend, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and MongoDB for data storage.

This project highlights fundamental concepts of web development, routing, templating, and database integration.

## Purpose
I developed this project to strengthen my application development skills and deepen my understanding of Python-based APIs and web technologies. As a software developer, I wanted to explore practical backend–frontend integration while refining my overall development workflow. I hope this project not only showcases my work but also inspires you to explore, learn, and build something of your own.
